                    <p>A punch is a striking blow with the fist.
                        It is used in most martial arts and combat sports, most notably boxing, 
                        where it is the only type of offensive technique allowed. In sports, 
                        hand wraps or other padding such as gloves may be used to protect athletes 
                        and practitioners from injuring themselves.</p>

                    <p>A kick is a physical strike using the leg, in unison usually with
                         an area of the knee or lower using the foot, as the human leg is
                          longer and stronger than the arm, kicks are generally used to keep 
                          an opponent at a distance, surprise them with their range and inflict 
                          substantial damage.</p>

                    <p>A knee strike is a strike with the knee, either with the kneecap or the surrounding area. 
                        The straight knee is a typical knee strike, and involves thrusting the front of the knee 
                        into the head or body of an opponent. The straight knee can be applied from a stand-up position
                         both when the combatants are separated, or when they are clinching.</p>
