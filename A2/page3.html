         <p>Fearing the unknown can cause stress. Dealing with a scary situation can also cause stress. 
            Taking a class in self-defense helps people ease their minds and forget their fears, 
            effectively relieving the stress they may have been feeling.</p></div>

        <div class="m1"><p class="m1-h">Safety</p>
         <p>Self-defense classes will give you the ability to protect yourself and overcome an attacker. 
            Knowing how to defend yourself can help you feel less anxious in public, or fearful when walking alone in the night. 
            You will learn the basics of how to quickly disable and protect yourself from an attacker so that you can escape.</p></div>

        <div class="m1"><p class="m1-h">Confidence</p>
         <p>A lot of people are unconfident with their abilities to protect themselves before they join a practice, 
             or take classes. This can be due to personal experiences, as well as driven by the news. 
             We hear a lot about the negativity in our society, and this can leave people feeling unprotected. 
             Self defense classes will build confidence in yourself.</p></div>
